## üîÅ Overall Process of the Website

The platform consists of **three main components**:

1. **Frontend (React):**
   - A modern landing page that introduces the services.
   - Provides two clear Call-To-Action buttons: one for Customer Support and one for Insurance Claim queries.
   - Connects directly to the backend Streamlit applications.

2. **Customer Support Agent (Streamlit + Gemini Flash):**
   - Users can enter general banking queries (e.g., credit cards, loans, account issues).
   - Responses are powered by the Gemini 1.5 Flash model, formatted with structured, user-friendly explanations.

3. **Insurance Claim Assistant (Streamlit + Gemini Flash + FAQ Priming):**
   - Handles insurance-related questions like how to claim, required documents, and claim status tracking.
   - Supports provider-specific queries by generating clickable helpful links for portals like LIC, SBI, HDFC Ergo, etc.
